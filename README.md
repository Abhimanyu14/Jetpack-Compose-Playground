## Introduction üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This is an example project that is using an early alpha version of Jetpack Compose https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/androidx-master-dev/compose/

# üè† Architecture

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
### Kotlin
[![jCenter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-1.3.40-green.svg)]()


### Project Structure
* <kbd>androidx_prebuilts</kbd> - This folder contains the Compose Libraries 1.0.0-alpha01 and the Compiler Plugin 1.0.0-alpha01
I compiled this versions from the AndroidX git repo. Because Compose is still in early alpha stage, Google doesn't offer any binaries online. In the AndroidX repo, Compose is used with a special Kotlin compiler "1.3.30-compose-20190503", but i figured out, it is also working with the Kotlin compiler v1.3.40-eap-21. 

* <kbd>app</kbd> - Base android project directory
* <kbd>compose</kbd> - a android library module that is using the compose libraries. It contains my example/test functions and 
the demo classes i copied out of the AndroidX repo (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-master-dev/ui/material/integration-tests/) 
Inside the MyComposeApp() you can change the demo page that should be opened
